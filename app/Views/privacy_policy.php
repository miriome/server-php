Even if you are not a user, information about you may appear in content created or published by users on the Platform. We may also collect UGC through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that UGC, for example, to enable you to publish images and videos faster and optimise your user experience. We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from the Platform or share content between it and a third party platform.
		</li>

			<b>Surveys, research and promotions:</b> We may collect information that you share through surveys or your participation in challenges, research, promotions, marketing campaigns, events, or contests.

			<b>Preferences:</b> We may collect your settings, style preferences and communication preferences.

That information includes the content of the message and information about the message, such as when it was sent, received, or read, and message participants.
